### 1. Show first name, last name, and gender of patients whose gender is 'M'.
* **Concepts Covered:** Column Selection (`SELECT`), Row Filtering (`WHERE`).

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    gender
FROM patients 
WHERE gender = 'M';
```
### 2. Show first name and last name of patients who do not have allergies.
* **Concepts Covered:** Missing Data Handling (`IS NULL`).

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    last_name 
FROM patients 
WHERE allergies IS NULL;
```
### 3. Show first name of patients that start with the letter 'C'.
* **Concepts Covered:** Pattern Matching (`LIKE`), Wildcard Filtering (`%`), String Functions (`LEFT`, `SUBSTRING`).

```sql
-- Method 1: Standard Wildcard (Recommended)
SELECT first_name 
FROM patients 
WHERE first_name LIKE 'C%';

-- Method 2: Using LEFT function
SELECT first_name 
FROM patients 
WHERE LEFT(first_name, 1) = 'C';

-- Method 3: Using SUBSTRING function
SELECT first_name 
FROM patients 
WHERE SUBSTRING(first_name, 1, 1) = 'C';
```
